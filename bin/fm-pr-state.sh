# Report the blockers this command can see on one GitHub pull request.
#
# This is a one-shot, read-only command. It reads the current pull request,
# reported checks, submitted reviews, and review decision from GitHub at
# invocation time. It never posts, requests, approves, or merges.
# Required-check blockers, including checks not yet reported, come from
# bin/fm-pr-checks.sh; its shared library owns the check policy.
# Empty output does not mean the pull request is ready to merge.
# A pull request that only awaits an approval (reviewDecision REVIEW_REQUIRED)
# is not reported as blocked. GitHub's reviewDecision owns whether reviews
# block; review history is printed only to explain CHANGES_REQUESTED, naming
# each reviewer whose latest verdict still requests changes and marking it
# STALE when it was left at a superseded head.
# A closed or merged pull request reports that terminal state and nothing else.
# Unresolved review-thread state is out of this command's scope.
#
# Usage: fm-pr-state.sh <pr-url>
#   Prints one line per blocker it can see and nothing when it sees none.
#   Blockers do not change the successful exit status; lookup or usage refusal
#   exits non-zero.
