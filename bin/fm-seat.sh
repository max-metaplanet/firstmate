# Choose which Claude account (seat) NEW claude workers launch on.

# Usage:
#   fm-seat.sh status
#   fm-seat.sh list
#   fm-seat.sh switch <name|default> [--force]
#   fm-seat.sh switch --next [--force]
#   fm-seat.sh probe [<name|default>]
#   fm-seat.sh add <name>
#   fm-seat.sh threshold [<percent>|off]
#   fm-seat.sh threshold-reached
#   fm-seat.sh arm [--interval <secs>] [--stable <n>]
#   fm-seat.sh retire
#
# status     Print the active seat, the configured auto-switch threshold, and
#            every live task's OWN recorded seat, so a switch can be read
#            against the workers it did not touch.
# list       Print every seat with its login state and account identity.
# switch     Point future claude workers at <name>. `default` clears the setting
#            and returns to the ambient login. `--next` rotates to the next
#            logged-in seat after the active one, which is what the threshold
#            watch fires. Rotation covers only named seats under the seats root:
#            the default profile is never a rotation target, because it is the
#            owner's own interactive login and can change account under them.
#            Refuses a seat that is not logged in, because a worker launched
#            there fails on its first message; --force overrides that refusal
#            when the probe itself cannot reach a verdict. After the switch it
#            runs bin/fm-config-push.sh --local-only so this machine's running local
#            secondmate homes take the new seat too, reporting each home.
# probe      Report whether a seat is logged in. Exit 0 logged in, 1 not logged
#            in, 2 undecided.
# add        Create an empty profile directory for a new seat and print the exact
#            login command the account owner runs. It never logs in, never reads
#            or writes any credential, and never touches the Keychain.
# threshold  Print, set, or clear the percent-remaining that trips an automatic
#            switch. Absent means no automatic switching.
# threshold-reached
#            The condition predicate: exit 0 when the active seat's remaining
#            quota is at or below the configured threshold, 1 when it is not,
#            and 2 when no threshold is configured or the read failed. Exit 2 is
#            an error to the watch, never a true, so an unreadable quota never
#            switches accounts.
# arm        Register the automatic switch as ONE condition->action watch through
#            bin/fm-procevent-when.sh: condition `threshold-reached`, action
#            `switch --next`. It fires at most once, which is the edge trigger,
#            and it runs on the watcher's existing cycle rather than a daemon of
#            its own. Re-arm after it fires to watch the next crossing.
# retire     Stop that watch.
#
# A switch NEVER disturbs a running worker. It rewrites one config file that only
# a fresh spawn reads; every live task keeps the profile recorded in its own task
# record, and its relaunches and resumes keep reading that record.
# bin/fm-seat-lib.sh owns the resolution rules; docs/claude-seats.md owns the
# operator procedure, including what the account owner must do to add a seat.
