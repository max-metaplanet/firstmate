# status     Print the active seat, all three automatic-mode settings, whether
#            the watch is armed, whether new Claude dispatch is held right now
#            and why (the same reason bin/fm-spawn.sh prints when it refuses a
#            spawn), every live task's OWN recorded seat, so
#            a switch can be read against the workers it did not touch, and every
#            local secondmate home that declines inherited seat settings, with
#            the seat that home is actually on, so a decline is never invisible.
# list       Print every seat with its login state and account identity.
# switch     Point future claude workers at <name>. `default` clears the setting
#            and returns to the ambient login. `--next` rotates to the next
#            qualifying seat after the active one, which is what the automatic
#            watch fires. Rotation covers only named seats under the seats root:
#            the default profile is never a rotation target, because it is the
#            owner's own interactive login and can change account under them.
#            Refuses a seat that is not logged in, because a worker launched
#            there fails on its first message; --force overrides that refusal
#            when the probe itself cannot reach a verdict. After the switch it
#            runs bin/fm-config-push.sh --local-only so this machine's running local
#            secondmate homes take the new seat too, reporting each home, and
#            naming each seat item a declining home skipped and why.
# probe      Report whether a seat is logged in. Exit 0 logged in, 1 not logged
#            in, 2 undecided.
# add        Create an empty profile directory for a new seat and print the exact
#            login command the account owner runs. It never logs in, never reads
#            or writes any credential, and never touches the Keychain.
# threshold  TRIGGER. Print, set, or clear the percent LEFT on the ACTIVE seat
#            that trips an automatic switch. Absent means no automatic switching.
# destination-min
#            DESTINATION HEADROOM. Print, set, or clear the percent LEFT a seat
#            must EXCEED to be a switch destination. Absent means the rotation
#            gate is login-only, exactly as it was before this setting existed,
#            and no candidate's quota is read at all.
# extra-usage
#            EXTRA-USAGE POLICY, for when no seat has headroom. `stop` holds new
#            Claude dispatch rather than starting workers that would run on paid
#            extra usage; `allow <usd>` keeps dispatching until the seat's
#            extra-usage spend reaches that dollar cap and holds after it;
#            `off` clears the policy and holds nothing. Absent means no hold of
#            any kind.
# threshold-reached
#            The trigger predicate: exit 0 when the active seat is at or below
#            the configured percent left, 1 when it is not, and 2 when no
#            threshold is configured or the read failed. Exit 2 is an error,
#            never a true, so an unreadable quota never switches accounts.
# auto       One pass of the automatic mode, run by the armed check shim: read
#            the active seat, switch when the trigger is met and a seat with
#            headroom exists, and print one line when firstmate should know.
#            Never run it in a loop of its own; `arm` gives it the watcher's.
# arm        Register `auto` as this home's repeating Claude-seat check through
#            bin/fm-check-register.sh, so it runs on the watcher's existing
#            cadence. It KEEPS watching after a switch rather than firing once:
#            a crossing fires at most once per seat, and the next seat's own
#            crossing fires again with no re-arming by hand.
# retire     Stop that watch and remove its record.
#
# WHAT THE AUTOMATIC MODE CANNOT DO. Firstmate controls which seat a NEW worker
# starts on, and whether new Claude work is dispatched at all. It cannot stop a
# worker that is ALREADY RUNNING from drawing paid extra usage mid-task; that is
# the organisation's Claude admin setting, not something any setting here
# reaches. So `extra-usage stop` means stop STARTING new work, plus a loud
# warning the moment a seat a worker is running on enters extra usage. It is
# never a guarantee of zero spend.
#
# A switch NEVER disturbs a running worker. It rewrites one config file that only
# a fresh spawn reads; every live task keeps the profile recorded in its own task
# record, and its relaunches and resumes keep reading that record.
#
# A switch reaches every local secondmate home by default, so the machine moves
# together. A home that must spend a different account - one home on a personal
# or client account while the rest run on the team account - declines by placing
# config/claude-seat-local in its OWN config dir; it then keeps its own three
# seat files and runs its own switch, threshold, and arm against itself.
# bin/fm-config-inherit-lib.sh owns that decline for every convergence point.
# bin/fm-seat-lib.sh owns the resolution rules; docs/claude-seats.md owns the
# operator procedure, including what the account owner must do to add a seat.

# The seat after the active one, in list order, that is logged in. Rotation

# Rotation covers ONLY named seats under the seats root. The default profile is
# deliberately excluded: it is the account owner's own interactive login, it
# changes under them whenever they sign in somewhere else, and nothing here can
# tell which account it currently holds. An automatic switch must not land
# workers on a store whose identity moved without anyone asking. `switch
# default` stays available as an explicit, manual choice.
#
# The seat set is read fresh from the seats root on every call, so this never
# assumes which seats exist or that any particular one is present.

# DESTINATION HEADROOM. With config/claude-seat-destination-min set, a candidate
# must also read MORE than that percent left, so a switch can never land on a
# seat that is nearly empty. A candidate whose quota gives no verdict is SKIPPED
# rather than guessed at in either direction: an ambiguous read is not evidence
# of headroom, and switching onto it would be the guess this refuses to make.
# With the setting absent no candidate quota is read at all and the gate is
# login-only, byte for byte the behaviour that predates it.

# Every rejected candidate is reported on stderr with its reason, so a refusal
# to switch always says which seats were considered and why none qualified.

# a destination that itself sits below the trigger is not switched away from
# on the very next poll; a switch rewrites it to the new seat, so that seat's
# OWN later crossing fires again with nothing to re-arm by hand.
# `blocked=<seat>` names the seat whose crossing has already been reported as
# having nowhere to go, or as a switch that failed. It silences only that
# report: every later poll still looks for a destination, so a candidate whose
# window resets is switched to at once. Both clear the moment the active seat
# reads back above the threshold.
# It also carries `extra=<seats>`, the set of seats last seen drawing paid extra
# usage, so that warning fires on ENTRY rather than on every poll for as long as
# the spend lasts.
