# Shared Claude seat resolution, used by bin/fm-seat.sh and bin/fm-spawn.sh.
# Usage: . bin/fm-seat-lib.sh   (after FM_ROOT, FM_HOME, and CONFIG are set)
#
# A "seat" is one Claude account, reached through a Claude Code profile
# directory named by CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. Claude Code derives that profile's
# Keychain service name from the directory path itself, so two seats never share
# a credential store and a worker pointed at a seat that was never logged in
# fails with "Not logged in" rather than silently spending the default account.
# docs/claude-seats.md owns the operator procedure and the login steps; this
# library owns only the resolution rules the spawn path and the seat command
# must agree on.
#
# The contract that makes a switch safe is that it changes only what the NEXT
# claude worker gets. A live worker keeps the profile it launched with, because
# that profile is recorded in its own task record at spawn time and every later
# launch for that task reads the RECORD, never this resolution. Moving a running
# worker between accounts would strand its session history, which lives under
# the profile directory, so the recorded value is a correctness requirement and
# not only a billing one.
#
# Five settings, all optional, all one line, all gitignored, and all inherited
# by LOCAL secondmate homes but never by a remote route
# (FM_MACHINE_LOCAL_INHERITABLE_CONFIG in bin/fm-config-inherit-lib.sh):
#   config/claude-seat            active seat NAME for new claude workers
#   config/claude-seats-root      where seat profile directories live
#   config/claude-seat-threshold  percent LEFT on the ACTIVE seat that trips an
#                                 automatic switch
#   config/claude-seat-destination-min
#                                 percent LEFT a seat must exceed to be a switch
#                                 DESTINATION
#   config/claude-seat-extra-usage
#                                 what to do when no seat has headroom: `stop`
#                                 or `allow <usd>`
# Every percentage counts percent LEFT, the same direction the quota viewer
# reports, so no setting has to be inverted against another. All five are off
# when absent; see the automatic-mode section at the foot of this file.
# A local home declines all five for itself with config/claude-seat-local, so it
# can spend a separate account; bin/fm-config-inherit-lib.sh owns that decline.
# docs/configuration.md "Claude seats" owns their schema.

# The reserved seat name for "the default login", which is the ambient profile
# Claude Code uses with no CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR set. It is never a directory under
# the seats root, and switching to it clears config/claude-seat.
