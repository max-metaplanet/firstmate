# The Claude Code Fleet mod (.claude/mods/firstmate-fleet) under the real installed
# Claude Code: `claude plugin validate --strict` on the physical folder and on the
# `.claude/skills/firstmate-fleet` path the project auto-loads it from, then its own
# `claude plugin test` suites (tests/*.test.ts inside the mod), which run the hooks
# module in the engine's own host against a mocked clock, environment, fleet reading,
# and drawing surface. No model turn is submitted and no credential is spent, so the
# guard runs by default wherever `claude` is installed; the portable checks that need
# no Claude Code binary live in tests/fm-fleet-mod.test.sh.
#
# What only the real binary can answer is the engine's own scan: which events the module
# hooks, which capabilities it reaches for, and which environment names it reads. A mod
# is not sandboxed, so that scan is the review surface, and this guard pins it: the
# reading command must appear only behind the refresh, never behind a drawing, and the
# module must read exactly its activation flag and the code-root override.
