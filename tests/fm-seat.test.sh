# Behavior tests for Claude seat switching: bin/fm-seat.sh and the seat half of
# bin/fm-spawn.sh.
#
# Every test here runs with no real Claude account and no network. The login
# probe and the quota read both shell out to `quota-axi`, so a fake quota-axi on
# PATH supplies the report each case needs; the scripts under test are driven
# through their real interfaces and never inspected as source.
#
# The property these tests exist to protect is that a switch changes only what
# the NEXT worker gets: a running task keeps the profile recorded in its own
# task record. The other half of that property - that a RELAUNCH reads the
# record rather than the home's current setting - is covered in
# tests/fm-control-relaunch.test.sh, which owns the fake backend that can prove
# a prior agent is gone and so is the only place a relaunch actually launches.
