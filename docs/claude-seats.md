# Claude seats: running workers on a second account

A **seat** is one Claude account that Firstmate's workers can run on.
Switching seats changes which account new workers bill to, without disturbing any worker already running.

Use this when one account's weekly limit is close and a second account is available, or when work should be split across accounts deliberately.
[`docs/configuration.md`](configuration.md) owns the setting schema; `bin/fm-seat.sh --help` owns the exact command surface.

## How it works, in one paragraph

Claude Code reads its profile - settings, session history, and credentials - from the directory named by `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, defaulting to `~/.claude`.
It derives that profile's macOS Keychain service name from a hash of the directory path, so each profile directory has its own credential store.
A seat is therefore just a directory, and switching seats is just choosing which directory the next worker launches with.
Firstmate never logs in, never copies a credential between profiles, and never touches the Keychain: only the account owner signs a seat in, personally.

**Keep every seat under the seats root, and leave the default profile out of the rotation.**
The default profile (`~/.claude`) is the account owner's own interactive login.
It changes whenever they sign in somewhere else, and nothing here can tell which account it currently holds, so an automatic switch must never land workers on it.
`switch --next` and the threshold watch therefore rotate only among named seats under the seats root; `switch default` remains available as an explicit, manual choice.
Creating one named seat per account, and leaving the default alone, keeps every account Firstmate uses identifiable and stable.

## Adding a second seat

If your machine is set up from the metaplanet-dev repository, build the seat with that repository's `claude-seats.sh setup`, documented in its `SETUP.md`, and then continue at step 2 below.
That script creates the seat directory and symlinks the shared body into it from your own `~/.claude`, so the seat carries your settings, hooks, skills, and agents while billing to its own account; it also verifies that two seats are not logged into the same account, and can undo itself.

Three steps, and only the second one needs the account owner.

**1. Create the seat.**

```
bin/fm-seat.sh add work
```

This creates an empty profile directory (by default `~/.claude-seats/work`) and prints the login command for step 2.
It writes nothing else and reads no credential.
`add` creates a bare directory and nothing more: a seat built this way has **none** of the owner's settings, hooks, skills, or agents, so it works but starts empty.
Use the `claude-seats.sh setup` route above when the seat should carry the shared body.

**2. The account owner logs in.**

This step cannot be automated and cannot be done on the owner's behalf.
In a terminal, the owner runs the command step 1 printed:

```
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-seats/work claude
```

then types `/login` in that session and signs in as the account this seat should bill to.
Claude Code stores the resulting credentials under a Keychain entry belonging to that directory, so they never mix with the default login.
The owner can then exit that session; it was only needed to carry out the sign-in.

**3. Confirm the seat is usable.**

```
bin/fm-seat.sh probe work
```

`logged-in` means the seat is ready.
`not-logged-in` means the profile was read and holds no login, so step 2 has not completed.
`unknown` means the probe could not decide; on macOS that is how a seat reads both before step 2 and after it until the one-time Keychain approval described under [Limits worth knowing](#limits-worth-knowing).

## Switching now

```
bin/fm-seat.sh switch work
```

That is the whole manual switch, and it takes effect immediately for the next worker launched.
`bin/fm-seat.sh switch default` returns to the ambient login.

A switch is refused when the target seat is not confirmed logged in, because every worker sent there would fail on its first message; `--force` crosses only an `unknown` verdict.

## What a switch does and does not touch

A switch rewrites one setting that only a fresh spawn reads.

- **New workers** launch on the new seat.
- **Running workers** keep the seat they started on. Their seat is recorded in their own task record at launch, and nothing rewrites it.
- **Relaunches** of an existing task reuse that recorded seat, never the current setting. Relaunch is the one path that starts a replacement agent for a task that already exists, so it is the one place this could have gone wrong. This matters beyond billing: a task's session history lives under its profile directory, so moving a task between seats would strand it.
- **Harness-changing relaunches** follow the harness. A task relaunched from another harness onto Claude has no Claude history yet, so it counts as a new worker and gets the active seat, never the default login. A task relaunched from Claude onto another harness records no seat any more.

`bin/fm-seat.sh status` shows the active seat alongside every task's own recorded seat, which is how to confirm a switch left running work alone.

## Switching automatically

The automatic path is the same switch, fired by a condition instead of by hand.
Every setting below is off until configured; there is no default that moves accounts, or holds work, on a home that never asked for it.
Every percentage counts **percent left**, the same direction the quota viewer reports, so no two settings here have to be mentally inverted against each other.

```
bin/fm-seat.sh threshold 15          # switch when the ACTIVE seat drops to 15% left
bin/fm-seat.sh destination-min 30    # only switch onto a seat with MORE than 30% left
bin/fm-seat.sh extra-usage stop      # when no seat qualifies, hold new work
bin/fm-seat.sh arm
```

### The three controls

**Trigger** (`threshold`) is when to look for a new seat: the active seat has dropped to or below that percent left.

**Destination headroom** (`destination-min`) is what counts as somewhere to go: a candidate must read **more** than that percent left.
A seat below it is skipped, and the refusal names each skipped seat with its measured headroom.
If no seat qualifies, nothing is switched.
Without this setting the rotation gate is login-only and no candidate's quota is read at all, which is how it behaved before the setting existed.

**Extra-usage policy** (`extra-usage`) is what to do when no seat qualifies and the active seat's plan quota is gone, so further work would run on paid extra usage.

- `stop` holds new Claude dispatch rather than starting workers on paid extra usage.
- `allow <usd>` keeps dispatching while that seat's extra-usage spend is below the dollar cap, and holds once it reaches it.
- `off` clears the policy, and nothing is held.

Spend is read from the `extra_usage` window the account itself reports, and the cap is a firstmate-side figure compared against it - deliberately a smaller, separate number from the account's own extra-usage ceiling.

`bin/fm-seat.sh status` prints all three settings and whether the watch is armed, and `bin/fm-seat.sh dispatch-check` answers the gate's question on demand.

### What the automatic mode cannot do

This is worth being exact about, because the setting is easy to read as a spend guarantee and it is not one.

Firstmate controls **which seat a new worker starts on**, and **whether new Claude work is dispatched at all**.
It cannot stop a worker that is *already running* from drawing paid extra usage mid-task.
A running worker keeps the profile recorded in its own task record, by design, and nothing outside the organisation's Claude admin setting can stop that profile spending once its plan quota is gone.

So `stop` means **stop starting new work**, plus a loud warning the moment a seat a worker is already running on enters extra usage.
That warning goes out through this home's one notification path, the same one the usage warner uses.
It is never a guarantee of zero spend, and nothing here should be read as one.

A single spawn can be pushed through a hold with `--ignore-seat-hold`; that changes no setting, so the next spawn is gated again.

### The watch

`arm` registers the automatic pass as this home's repeating Claude-seat check, so it runs on the supervision cycle that already exists rather than a daemon of its own.
It **keeps watching after a switch**: one crossing fires at most once per seat, and when the seat it moved to later crosses its own threshold, that fires again with nothing re-armed by hand.
`bin/fm-seat.sh retire` stops it and removes its record.

### What never trips a switch

Only the account-level windows (`all_models` and `all_products`) count toward the trigger, the same scopes the dispatch chooser applies to a worker with no specific model; a model- or product-only window such as an Opus weekly limit does not trip a switch on its own.
For the `default` seat the condition reads the same profile a new worker on it gets, which is firstmate's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when that is set.

An unreadable or ambiguous quota is never guessed at, in either direction:

- The **active** seat's quota unreadable means no switch, and the watch stays silent rather than waking on every poll.
- A **candidate** seat's quota unreadable means that seat is skipped, and the output says the quota could not be read rather than implying a number.
- With an extra-usage policy configured, an unreadable quota **holds** dispatch, because launching anyway would be exactly the guess the policy was set to avoid. The hold lifts on its own once the quota reads again.

A rotation with no qualifying seat refuses rather than pretending to switch, and never falls back to the default profile.

`bin/fm-seat.sh threshold off`, `destination-min off`, and `extra-usage off` each clear their own setting.

## Secondmate homes

All five seat settings are inherited into this machine's local secondmate homes through the primary-authoritative configuration contract, so a secondmate's own Claude crewmates launch on the same seat as the primary's.
Every switch, manual or automatic, runs `bin/fm-config-push.sh --local-only` right after it changes the primary's seat, so running local secondmates pick up the new seat without being stopped, and the switch prints which homes were updated and which were not.
A failed push never undoes the primary's switch: it is reported, those homes keep spawning on their previous seat, and re-running `bin/fm-config-push.sh --local-only` retries them.
The push skips remote routes entirely, so a switch never opens SSH, never waits on another machine, and reports only this machine's homes.
Remote secondmate homes on other machines never receive seat settings, because a seat is a Keychain-backed profile logged in on this machine only; a remote home keeps its own login exactly as before seats existed.
The seats themselves live outside any firstmate home - by default under `~/.claude-seats` - so the owner logs into a seat once and every home on the machine reaches the same profile.
A home that needs its own set of seats overrides `config/claude-seats-root`.

### One home on a separate account

The default above is the whole machine moving together, and it stays the default.
When one local home must spend a different account - a personal or client account while the rest run on the team account - that home declines the inheritance itself:

```
touch <that home>/config/claude-seat-local
```

The file's presence is the whole setting; nothing reads its content.
From then on that home keeps its own `claude-seat`, `claude-seats-root`, `claude-seat-threshold`, `claude-seat-destination-min`, and `claude-seat-extra-usage` untouched, including when it has none, and no local convergence overwrites them: not a switch's push, not the session-start secondmate sweep, and not that home's own launch or relaunch.
The declining home still runs `bin/fm-seat.sh switch`, `threshold`, `destination-min`, `extra-usage`, and `arm` normally; those act on itself alone.
Only that home is left alone - every other local home still takes each switch, and a machine with no such file anywhere behaves exactly as it did before the flag existed.

The decline is visible from the primary, because a setting that silently does nothing is the failure worth avoiding here.
`bin/fm-seat.sh status` lists every local secondmate home that declined, with the seat that home is actually on, and each switch names the seat items it skipped for that home and why.
Put the flag only in the home it belongs to: it is never inherited, so one home's billing choice is never decided for it elsewhere.
[Configuration](configuration.md#claude-seats-configclaude-seat-configclaude-seats-root-configclaude-seat-threshold-configclaude-seat-destination-min-configclaude-seat-extra-usage-configclaude-seat-local) owns the flag's schema.

## Limits worth knowing

The login probe runs `quota-axi` against the seat's profile and treats an `oauth` source as logged in.
Note that `quota-axi --profile-only` is **not** a usable probe here: that flag reads only a credential file and never the Keychain, so on macOS it reports "credentials missing" for a perfectly good seat.

A newly logged-in seat gets its own Keychain entry, and reading it from a different tool can require a one-time macOS approval.
Until that approval is given, the Keychain read is refused, and that refusal looks the same whether the seat was never logged into or is signed in but not yet approved.
The probe cannot tell those two apart, so it reports `unknown` for both, and a plain `switch` refuses.
To settle it, the owner runs `quota-axi --allow-keychain-prompt` once with that seat's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set and answers the prompt with "Always Allow"; after that a signed-in seat probes as `logged-in`.
In the meantime `switch --force` accepts the uncertainty: if the seat turns out to be empty, the next worker stops on its first message with `Not logged in` rather than spending another account.
`--force` never overrides `not-logged-in`, which the probe reports only when the evidence positively shows no login.
On macOS that means `not-logged-in` is rarely seen, because an absent Keychain entry reads as unreadable rather than as read-and-empty; on a file-backed credential store, where an empty profile really can be read and found empty, it is reported normally.
`--force` also never switches to a seat with no profile directory under the seats root; create it with `fm-seat.sh add <name>` first.

Two things in the setup flow above are **written from Claude Code's documented behaviour and the isolation this change verified, not from an observed sign-in**, because verifying them would mean logging in, which this work deliberately does not do:

- the exact prompts `/login` shows in a brand-new empty profile, and
- whether signing into a second account affects an already running session on the default profile.

Treat step 2 as the shape of the flow rather than a transcript, and expect the sign-in screens to be whatever the installed Claude Code shows.
What *was* verified directly is the part the mechanism depends on: a profile directory that was never logged into does not fall back to the default account, it stops with `Not logged in`, and each profile gets its own Keychain entry derived from its directory path.

This page is verified on macOS only, and its probe and login behaviour are described in terms of the macOS Keychain: seats are separated because Claude Code derives a Keychain service name from the profile directory's path, and the `unknown` verdict and one-time approval above are Keychain behaviours.
On Linux, where Claude Code keeps credentials in a file inside the profile directory rather than in the Keychain, the same directory separation applies but those Keychain-specific readings do not; that platform is unverified here, and Windows is out of scope.

Seat switching covers Claude workers only.
Other harnesses have their own credential stores and are unaffected by these settings.
